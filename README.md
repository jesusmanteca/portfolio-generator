Ingredients: 
    1 large eggplant, top removed and cut into slices the long way (top to bottom)
    sea salt
    3 tbsp olive oil
    1 tsp garlic powder
    1 tsp paprika

    Instructions

    On rack over a lipped baking sheet, lay out the eggplant and generously sprinkle with salt and let them sit for a min of 30 mins. I like to let them sit for an hour to ensure all the bitter moisture is removed. NOTE: don't worry about over-salting as this isn't for seasoning, just to help release that bitter liquid.

    Preheat oven to 400F.

    After 30-60 mins, wipe away the salt and moisture with a clean dish towel or paper towel and drain any liquid the sheet caught, and wipe dry. You are going to want to press firmly to ensure you get all the moisture.

    Cut each slice in half (the short way), and brush olive oil over each slice, ensuring they're totally covered, and place on a lined baking sheet.

    Sprinkle with salt, garlic powder and paprika. Act quickly because eggplants act like a sponge and you want to get them into the oven AS SOON as they're oiled and seasoned.

    Roast in the oven for 40 to 60 minutes, until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

    To serve, these can be drizzled with delicious tahini dressing and sprinkle with parsley as a side, smeared on hot bread as a snack or appetizer, used to make Norma pasta, or turned in a sabich sandwich or placed on tahini toast.
